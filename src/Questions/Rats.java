/*
a func accepts two +ve int(r and unit) and a +ve int array(arr) of size n as its args.
r represents no of rats present in an area and unit is the amount of food each rat consumes and 
each i'th element of array(arr) represents the amount of food present in i+1 house number
where 0<=i.
notes:
return -1 if the array is null
return 0 if the total amount of food from all houses is not sufficient for all the rats
computed values lie within the integer range

Example:
r:7, unit 2, n: 8
arr: 2 8 3 5 7 4 1 2
op=4

total amount of food required for all rats=r*unit
the amount of food in first houses=2+8+3+5=18
since the amount of in first 4 houses is sufficient for all rats the output is 4
